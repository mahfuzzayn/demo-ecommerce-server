# Review Module

## Overview
The Review module handles product reviews and ratings. Customers submit reviews with a rating (1-5) and description. Each user can only submit **one review per product**, and the review is checked against the user's **orders** to confirm they actually purchased the product. When a review is created, the product's average rating and rating count are automatically updated.

## How It Works
- **List reviews** – Public route, returns non-flagged reviews with user and product details
- **Get single review** – Public route, returns a specific non-flagged review
- **My reviews** – Customer-only. Returns the authenticated customer's own reviews (including flagged ones) with pagination
- **Create review** – Customer-only. Validates: product exists + active, the user **has not already reviewed it**, and computes `isVerifiedPurchase` by looking up the user's orders
- **Verified purchase** – `isVerifiedPurchase` is `true` only when the user has a `Processing`/`Shipped`/`Completed` order containing that product (a `Pending` or `Cancelled` order does not count)
- **Rating sync** – Creating a review triggers an aggregation to recalculate the product's `averageRating` and `ratingCount`

}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Review created successfully",
    "data": {
        "_id": "review_id_1",
        "rating": 4,
        "description": "Great product! Highly recommended.",
        "user": { "_id": "user_id", "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com", "photoUrl": "" },

        "updatedAt": "2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z"
